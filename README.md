# Genetic Algorithm-Based Robot Path Planning with the Extraction of Topological Map

## Overview
This project includes several implementations and methodologies for path planning, multi-goal planning, and optimization algorithms. It features codes for A*, Theta*, DKGA, DAG+DKGA, and other proposed methods.

### Directory Structure:
- **A_star_theta_star**: Code for Theta* and A* (smooth versions).
- **GA_paper**: Implementation of DKGA and DAG+DKGA.
- **map**: Maps for single-goal path planning experiments.
- **multi-goal**: Code for multi-goal path planning.
- **proposed_method**: Code for the proposed method.

## Installation Instructions

To run the code, you need the following Python libraries. You can install them using `conda` by running the following commands:

```bash
conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib
conda install networkx
conda install xlrd
conda install scipy
